## React Scope
### Visualize your React code as it executes.

*Add description here*

## Setup

1. Install React Scope from Chrome web store.
2. (Important) Install React Developer Tools, if you haven't already.
3. Make sure to enable "Allow access to file URLs" in the extension settings for React Scope.
4. Run your React application.
5. Open Chrome Developer Tools -> React Scope panel.

## Usage

Hover over the DOM nodes in the side panel to see their **state** and **props**.

Use your app to make changes to state! (e.g. trigger click events, submit data).

Every state change will update the DOM hierarchy visualization in the side panel and you can click the **next / prev** buttons to navigate between current and previous states of your application.
